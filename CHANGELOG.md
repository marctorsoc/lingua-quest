2023-12-26:
- Better sentencization:
  - We used to join all text, then split with spaCy sentencizer. Now relying on subtitles splits, and joining "..." or starting with lowercase
  - Split into two sents if "\n" found
- Better vocabulary generation. Adding extra words to complement spacy.vocab.strings, based on 1) wordnet, 2) unimorph
- Better answer generation. Now can mask sentences with only one maskable token but multiple non-maskable (but still valid tokens i.e. alpha and len <=2)
- Translating texts in Colab: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/182W-BRAL8cyQ3xFn-M-CdeTDE9uyGj-L#scrollTo=ZYEGSAWziUJY
