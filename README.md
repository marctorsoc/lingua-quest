# What's this

This is a language learning app, inspired by [Cloze Master](https://www.clozemaster.com/), a popular app for learning languages. The twist here is to learn from movies, tv series, and books, i.e. from stories. While `Cloze Master`'s motto is to *learn in context*, one still learns from sentences coming in a random order, from a dictionary of millions of sentences. Instead, here we follow stories, *learning in a sequential context*.

This app does not help in learning the basics of a language. It is recommended for language learners with **at least an A2 level**. You won't learn grammar or basic vocabulary, but practice/extend vocabulary and see applications of what you already know.

Please note that there are still a ton of features to be implemented, see [Pending work](#pending-work) section for more details. 

It seems to grow faster than I can implement them, so if you want to contribute, please create an issue! This does not mean you'll need to code it, it can give me ideas too.

To install, run `npm install`

# Running

To start the app, `npm start`. This requires a working Internet connection.

To run it offline `npx expo start --offline`

# Debugging

# Building

## First time

Follow https://docs.expo.dev/build/introduction/. Summary:

* `npm install --global eas-cli`
* `eas init --id a9...` (you will need to create an account on expo.dev)
* `eas build:configure`

## Once everything configured

Just run `eas build -p android --profile preview`, and wait for some time (> 10min):
```bash
~/...../lingua-quest ‚ùØ eas build -p android --profile preview
‚úî Using remote Android credentials (Expo server)
