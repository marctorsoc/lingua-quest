# What's this

This is a language learning app, inspired by [Cloze Master](https://www.clozemaster.com/), a popular app for learning languages. The twist here is to learn from movies, tv series, and books, i.e. from stories. While `Cloze Master`'s motto is to *learn in context*, one still learns from sentences coming in a random order, from a dictionary of millions of sentences. Instead, here we follow stories, *learning in a sequential context*.

# Who is this for?

This app does not help in learning the basics of a language. It is recommended for language learners with **at least an A2 level**. You won't learn grammar or basic vocabulary, but practice/extend vocabulary and see applications of what you already know.

# How to use?

As of writing, there are two modes: reading mode, and standard mode. In reading mode, you'll just be reading without any interaction. In standard mode, you'll be tasked with filling the gap in the sentence with one of the 4 options presented. Please note that the standard mode can be hard, even for natives! That's because the wrong answers are not simply random. I plan to add `easy` mode in the future. For those days where you don't feel like a challenge, but still want to continue the story :)

In case of movies / tv series, I strongly recommend to re-watch them before starting the story in `Lingua Quest`, unless you know it by heart, e.g. me with `Back to the Future`. Take into account that reading only subtitles will exclude all the scenes without dialogues, or suddenly change location and characters from one sentence to the next. At the moment, we don't even have an indication of who is the speaker. For all these reasons, the story might be hard to follow at times. 

# Short note on status

Please note that there are still a ton of features to be implemented, see [Pending work](#pending-work) section for more details.

It seems to grow faster than I can implement them, so if you want to contribute, please create an issue! This does not mean you'll need to code it. It can give me ideas too.

To install, run `npm install`

# Running

To start the app, `npm start`. This requires a working Internet connection.

To run it offline `npx expo start --offline`

# Debugging
Running react-dev-tools. In a separate terminal, run `react-dev-tools`. This should open a new window.

# Building

## First time

Follow https://docs.expo.dev/build/introduction/. Summary:

* `npm install --global eas-cli`
* `eas init --id a9...` (you will need to create an account on expo.dev)
* `eas build:configure`

## Once everything configured

Just run `eas build -p android --profile preview`, and wait for some time (> 10min):
```bash
~/...../lingua-quest ‚ùØ eas build -p android --profile preview
‚úî Using remote Android credentials (Expo server)
‚úî Using Keystore from configuration: Build Credentials y-NTnpaOgo (default)
