# LinguaQuest: Learn a Language Through Stories! üìö

LinguaQuest is a unique app that helps you build vocabulary and comprehension by immersing you in stories from your favorite movies, TV series, and books. Inspired by [ClozeMaster](https://www.clozemaster.com/) and contextual learning, LinguaQuest lets you follow narratives, helping you learn in a sequential context for a more natural language experience.

Disclaimer: this is far from production code, but hey, my first react native project, and multi-platform! (*)! üí™

(*) only tested on Android and web

# üåü Key Features:

* Story-Based Learning: Learn through engaging, real-world stories that keep you interested and motivated.
* Two Practice Modes: Choose Reading Mode to enjoy the story without interaction or Standard Mode for challenging fill-in-the-blank exercises.
* Advanced Vocabulary Building: Perfect for intermediate learners (A2 level or above) looking to expand beyond basic vocabulary.
* Support for Multiple Languages: LinguaQuest currently helps you learn English, Spanish, Catalan and Lithuanian. The app menus are also available in these four languages, whereas stories have translations to English and Spanish. More languages coming soon!

# üîπ Who is LinguaQuest for? 

LinguaQuest is ideal for language learners with some foundation in the language. This app doesn‚Äôt cover basic grammar or beginner vocabulary but instead focuses on vocabulary expansion and contextual understanding. It‚Äôs great for intermediate to advanced learners aiming to deepen their knowledge.

# üí° How to Use LinguaQuest

* Reading Mode: Simply follow the story, absorbing vocabulary as you go.
* Standard Mode: Challenge yourself by filling in blanks with the correct words from four options. The distractor words are thoughtfully chosen, so it can be tough‚Äîeven for native speakers!
* For Movies/TV Stories: Refresh your memory by re-watching before starting. LinguaQuest doesn‚Äôt show scene transitions or speaker names, so familiarity with the story helps you stay on track.

Experience language learning in a new way with LinguaQuest. Dive into the stories you love and enhance your language skills through engaging, contextual practice. Start your language journey today!

# Short note on status

Please note that there are still a ton of features to be implemented, see [Pending work](#pending-work) section for more details.

It seems to grow faster than I can implement them, so if you want to contribute, please create an issue! This does not mean you'll need to code it. It can give me ideas too.
