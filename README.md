# LinguaQuest: Learn a Language Through Stories! üìö

LinguaQuest is a unique, free language learning app designed to build your vocabulary and comprehension by immersing you in stories from movies, TV series, and books. Inspired by [ClozeMaster](https://www.clozemaster.com/) and contextual learning, LinguaQuest lets you follow narratives, learning in a sequential context for a more natural language experience.

_Disclaimer: This is still a work in progress, but it's my first React Native project‚Äîand it‚Äôs multi-platform! (*) üí™_

_(*) only tested on Android and web_

# üåü Key Features:

* **Story-Based Learning**: Learn through engaging, familiar stories that keep you interested and motivated.
* **Two Practice Modes**: Choose Reading Mode to enjoy the story without interaction or Standard Mode for challenging fill-in-the-blank exercises.
* **Advanced Vocabulary Building**: Perfect for intermediate learners (A2 level or above) looking to expand beyond basic vocabulary.
* **Offline Access**: Use LinguaQuest without an internet connection, so you can learn anywhere ‚Äî even on a plane.
* **Support for Multiple Languages**: LinguaQuest currently helps you learn English, Spanish, Catalan and Lithuanian. The app menus are also available in these four languages, whereas stories have translations to English and Spanish. More languages coming soon!

# üîπ Who is LinguaQuest for? 

LinguaQuest is ideal for learners with a foundational understanding of the language. It doesn‚Äôt cover basic grammar or beginner vocabulary, focusing instead on expanding vocabulary and enhancing contextual understanding. Perfect for intermediate to advanced learners looking to deepen their skills!

# üí° How to Use LinguaQuest

* **Reading Mode**: Simply follow the story, absorbing vocabulary as you go.
* **Standard Mode**: Challenge yourself by filling in blanks with the correct words from four options. The distractor words are thoughtfully chosen, so it can be tough‚Äîeven for native speakers!
* **For Movies/TV Stories**: Refresh your memory by re-watching before starting. LinguaQuest doesn‚Äôt show scene transitions or speaker names, so familiarity with the story helps you stay on track.

Experience language learning in a new way with LinguaQuest. Dive into the stories you love, enhance your language skills, and enjoy the flexibility of learning offline. Start your language journey today ‚Äî free and accessible wherever you go!

# Short note on status

Please note that there are still a ton of features to be implemented, see [Pending work](#pending-work) section for more details.

It seems to grow faster than I can implement them, so if you want to contribute, please create an issue! This does not mean you'll need to code it. It can give me ideas too.

To install, run `npm install`

# Running

To start the app, `npm start`. This requires a working Internet connection.

To run it offline `npx expo start --offline`

# Debugging
Running react-dev-tools. In a separate terminal, run `react-dev-tools`. This should open a new window.

# Building

## First time

Follow https://docs.expo.dev/build/introduction/. Summary:

* `npm install --global eas-cli`
* `eas init --id a9...` (you will need to create an account on expo.dev)
* `eas build:configure`

## Once everything configured

Just run `eas build -p android --profile preview`, and wait for some time (> 10min):
```bash
~/...../lingua-quest ‚ùØ eas build -p android --profile preview
‚úî Using remote Android credentials (Expo server)
‚úî Using Keystore from configuration: Build Credentials y-NTnpaOgo (default)

Compressing project files and uploading to EAS Build. Learn more
‚úî Uploaded to EAS 2s

Build details: https://expo.dev/accounts/marc.torsoc/projects/lingua-quest/builds/cb2dfa67-5f3e-4b45-afd6-6afcbc8ecfc0
```
This will create an `apk` file that you can download and install on your Android device.

## Google Play

To publish to Google Play, you need to create a Google Play Developer account and follow the instructions in the [Expo documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/distribution/app-stores/).

At some point, we're asked to create an `aab` file (Android App Bundle). This is a file that contains the app and all its dependencies. To create this file, we need to run the following command:

# Updating translations

Go to `raw.js` and update. Then run `node raw.js` to generate all `$language.json` files.

# Creating logos

* Dall-E creates images, but they webp
* Transform images from webp to png + crop with [ezgif](https://ezgif.com/webp-to-png)
* Use [remove.bg](https://www.remove.bg/) to remove background, and remove objects
* To create consistent characters, see [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc2f2oTaR7U)
