      "STAGE_0": "Welcome to LinguaQuest! Here you will learn a new language while replaying your favorite stories.",
      "STAGE_1": "We recommend at least mid A2 level (preferably studying B1) for a more pleasant experience. Otherwise, it might be frustrating and you'll stop playing.",
      "STAGE_2": "In this tutorial, we'll see the basic functions of the app. We won't go over all details, as we understand you're eager to start learning ðŸ¤“ Feel free to swipe down to skip the tutorial.",
      "STAGE_3": "Below this message, you have the tabs to navigate. In this screen (Play), we see the stories available to play, their length and your progress. Some stories are part of a collection. Press to navigate into the folder.",
      "STAGE_4": "On top, you can see what language you are learning, and from what language, that is, the language for translations. You can change this by selecting the filter button on the right.",
      "STAGE_5": "Let's press now on any story, and we'll review how to play.",
      "STAGE_6": "Exciting! So the \"game\" consists in guessing the word that is missing in the sentence. You have four possible answers, and one of them is correct.",
      "STAGE_7": "After selecting one option, the answer will be revealed & the translation. Click next to continue.",
      "STAGE_8": "And now, next sentence. If you want to see again the translation for the first sentence, show it again by pressing on it. Let's do it.",
      "STAGE_9": "Translations are not the best. So you can also press & hold on a sentence. This will copy it, so you can send it to your native friend, or double-check on Google Translate.",
      "STAGE_10": "Finally, let's see what you can configure in Settings.",
      "STAGE_11": "Here, you can change the sentences per round. Default is 2 but we recommend 10 for a better experience. This is important because to move to next round you need to correctly fill in all sentences.",
      "STAGE_12": "You can also configure how many rounds of history to show. In case you want to review the story.",
      "STAGE_13": "As per request of our users, we added a \"reading mode\", where you don't have to guess. Just read. For those days you don't feel like it",
      "STAGE_14": "And... this completes the tutorial ðŸŽ‰ Everything else is obvious or not essential. Hope you enjoy learning, and any feedback super welcome. Thanks for using LinguaQuest! ðŸ¤—"
